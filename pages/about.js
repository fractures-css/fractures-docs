				This is a small project, in which I try to simplify my life by abstracting away the complexities UI design has to offer üò®. I use
				this for quick prototyping; and in some cases, for production where I build a <b>design system</b> on top of it.

					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ul className="list-disc ml-3">
						<li>You can design with &mdash; not around it. Leaves UI untouched.</li>
						<li>Atomic, non blocking.</li>
						<li>Manageable cognitive load, with a small footprint.</li>
						<li>Fast in every way.</li>
						<li>Framework agnostic.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h3>Problems</h3>
					<ul className="list-disc ml-3">
						<li>
							I don't think percentage based CSS breakpoint are universal enough, so you have to handle
							{` `}
							<b>responsive</b> states yourself.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can use it in production, but you have to create your own <b>fallbacks</b>. The{" "}
							<a target="_new" href="https://unpkg.com/fractures/dist/fractures.prefixed.min.css">
								prefixed
							</a>{" "}
							version handles some, but not everything.

			<h3>Inspiration</h3>
			<p className="my-2">
				I started this as my own reset.css when having a reset css was cool. It was grown into a common.css, then a tools.css. Now is
				somewhat atomic.
