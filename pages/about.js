				This is a small project, in which I try to simplify my life by abstracting away the complexities
				{` `}
				UI design has to offer üò®. I use fractures for <b>rapid prototyping</b> and building out <b>design systems</b>.

						<li>You can design with &mdash; not around it. Leaves UI untouched.</li>
						<li>Atomic, non blocking.</li>

						<li>

							<b>responsive</b> states yourself.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can use it in production, but you have to create your own <b>fallbacks</b>. The{' '}

			<h4>Inspiration</h4>
			<p className="my-2">
				I started this prject as my own reset.css when having a reset css was cool.
				{` `}
				It was grown into a common.css, then a tools.css. Now it's somewhat atomic.
