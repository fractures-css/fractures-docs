					<ul className="list-disc ml-3">
						<li>You can design with &mdash; not around it. Leaves UI untouched.</li>
						<li>Atomic, non blocking.</li>
						<li>Manageable cognitive load with a small footprint.</li>
						<li>Fast in every way.</li>
						<li>Framework agnostic.</li>

					<h3 className="mb-1">Problems</h3>
					<ul className="list-disc ml-3">
						<li>
							I don't think percentage based CSS breakpoints are universal enough, so you have to handle
							{` `}
							<b>responsive</b> states yourself.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can use it in production, but you have to create your own <b>fallbacks</b>. The{' '}

							version handles some, but not everything.

			<h3>Inspiration</h3>
			<p className="my-2">
				I started this project as my own reset.css when having a reset css was cool.
				{` `}
				It was grown into a common.css, then a tools.css. Now it's somewhat atomic.
			</p>
			<p className="my-2">I've also learned some tricks from these smart people:</p>

				The concept of functional CSS is not new. There are quite a few similar projects out there you can choose from if you looking for
